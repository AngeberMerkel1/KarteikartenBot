run the code inside spaced_repetition.py
use file to import questions in json format like this:
{
    "chapter_name": "Chapter 1",
    "questions": [
        {"question": "What is ...?", "answer": "It is ..."},
        ...
    ]
} 

just create a JSON file and copy paste the code snippet.

to generate the questions, i recomend GPT4. just upload a pdf to gpt4 and ask it to generate questions in the format and copy paste them into jour JSON file.
Now the questions are ready for upload.

the menubar select chapter will automatically update after the import and make your imported questions available to select. 

under file->view questions, you can see the level that your questions are at

Future ideas: Get the GPT4 api into the project and generate questions and import them automatically by just importing the pdf into this program directly
