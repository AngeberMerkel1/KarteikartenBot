run the code inside spaced_repetition.py
use file to import questions in json format like this:
{
    "chapter_name": "Chapter 1",
    "questions": [
        {"question": "What is ...?", "answer": "It is ..."},
        ...
    ]
} 

just create a JSON file and copy paste the code snippet.

to generate the questions, i recomend GPT4. just upload a pdf to gpt4 and ask it to generate questions in the format and copy paste them into jour JSON file.
Now the questions are ready for upload.

Before importing a new chapter of questions, you must first create a new topic. these topics represent different courses, where you can organize your questions. 
that way all your course questions are stored separately and you can prepare for each course individually

the menubar select chapter will automatically update after the import and make your imported questions available to select. 

under file->view questions, you can see the level that your questions are at

Future ideas: Get the GPT4 api into the project and generate questions and import them automatically by just importing the pdf into this program directly

if you want you can simply delete all the questions and topics with file->delete. but just erasing the database file is easyer and less buggy. 
the database file will be created a new upon re running the program
